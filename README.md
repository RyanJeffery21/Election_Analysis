## Expanded Uses
This script could be expanded for larger elections by expanding the dictionaries to include other counties, in the case of a state-wide election. This script could also be written to include the voter turnout percentage of the specific counties.  Denver county may be the most populated of the counties and would explain why most of the voters came from this county.  This information could help a candidate decide where they should spend their time campaigning.
